# Edge Config App

The Edge Config App is a web application for operations and engineering teams to manage configurations across a fleet of IIoT Edge devices.
It communicates with the [Edge Config Api](https://github.com/eclipse-sealman/sealman-edge-config-api) and the [SEALMAN Ems](https://github.com/eclipse-sealman/sealman-ems).

### Prerequisites

Node 22+ is required. Install it via nvm (one-time setup):

```bash
nvm install 22
```

### Running locally

**Local (cross platform):**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Devcontainer:** open the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P`) -> `Reopen in Container`, then run the same commands above.

Visit http://localhost:3000

**To activate SSL on the dev server:** add `VITE_USE_DEV_SERVER_SSL=true` to your `.env.local`.

## Environment Setup

Copy `env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values.

`VITE_VERSION` is baked into the container image at build time; all other variables must be injected at runtime when deploying with Docker.

### General

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URI` | Yes | Base URL of the Edge Config API. |
| `VITE_VERSION` | No | Application version shown in the UI. Defaults to `local-development`. |
| `VITE_WEBVNC_URI` | No | Base URL of the WebVNC API. Required for the WebVNC feature. |
| `VITE_WEBVNC_API_KEY` | No | API key for the WebVNC API. |
| `VITE_SEMS_API_URL` | Yes | Base URL of the Smart EMS API. |

### Authentication

Set `VITE_AUTHENTICATION_PROVIDER` to `keycloak` (default) or `entra` and fill in the corresponding variables below.

| Variable | Provider | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_AUTHENTICATION_PROVIDER` | - | Authentication provider to use: `keycloak` or `entra`. Defaults to `keycloak`. |
| `VITE_KEYCLOAK_AUTHORITY` | keycloak | Keycloak realm URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/realms/local-dev`). |
| `VITE_KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID` | keycloak | Keycloak client ID. |
| `VITE_ENTRA_ID_AUTHORITY` | entra | Entra ID authority URL. |
| `VITE_ENTRA_ID_CLIENT_ID` | entra | Entra ID application (client) ID. |
| `VITE_ENTRA_ID_REDIRECT_URI` | entra | Redirect URL after login (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). |
| `VITE_API_SCOPES` | entra | Comma-separated OAuth scopes requested when acquiring API tokens. |

### API access errors

Assets and the VPN endpoint list show "Not permitted" after an API 403 and hide previously loaded restricted results. The affected workflow stops automatic requests until an explicit retry or a device/account change. Gateway VPN controls remain available independently.

Applications stops config-status polling after HTTP 400 or 403; retry explicitly or correct the module IDs to resume. System module IDs such as `$edgeAgent` and `$edgeHub` are sent unchanged. If saving additional scan ports is denied, the custom scan can still use those ports temporarily without retrying the save in the background.

### Extension credentials

Platform Configuration > Extensions requires `extension.read`. Registration, editing, internal-key rotation, and device-key issue/revoke require `extension.register`; disabling/deregistering requires `extension.deregister`. The API remains authoritative if access changes.

Registration displays `internal_key` once when returned by the API. Internal routes use `X-Internal-Key`; rotation invalidates the previous key immediately. HTTP routes with `device` visibility use per-device `X-Device-Key` credentials on the field-ingress API. Their detail page lists key metadata and allows issuing/replacing or confirming revocation of a key. Optional module IDs are metadata, not an authentication restriction.

Copy newly issued credentials before closing their dialogs: they are not saved to browser storage or query caches, and cannot be retrieved by the UI later. Device-key endpoints and registration-time keys require the corresponding local API changes; the published older API does not provide them.

## Running in Docker

```bash
docker build . -t edge-configuration-app
docker run --rm --name edge-configuration-app -p 3000:8080 \
	-e VITE_SEMS_API_URL="https://smart-ems.example.com" \
	edge-configuration-app
```
